Optimization Methods
==========

Here, the various concepts related to the Optimization Methods were learned and some were implemented too.

Car to Customer Allocation Optimization
====

    assignment11.m   -   m cars and n customers , minimize the total cost of the assignment made. 
Linear Assignment Problem
Using Hungarian Algorithm, the optimal assignment is made. Logically working in all cases.

    assignment12.m   -   m cars and n customers , minimize the maximum of the individual times of the assignment made.
Linear Bottleneck Assignment Problem / Time Minimizing Assignment Problem
The time matrix is transformed into a matrix which is given as an input for the Hungarian algorithm - Mimic algorithm. Logically working in all cases.

    assignment13.m   -   minimize above both conditions. 
The product of cost and time matrix is given as input to the Hungarian algorithm to minimize both the conditions. Gives optimal solution in most cases.


Graham's Scan 
=====
To find the minimum Convex Hull
    
    assignment2.m - Graham's Scan to find the minimum Convex Hull.

Inverse of a Matrix
=====
To the find the inverse of a square matrix and output the inverse if it exists else find the pivot and free variables in the matrix and represent the general solution x in terms of the free variables (independent of the pivot variables)

    assignment3.m - Inverse of Matrix (if it exists else representation of general solution in terms of free variables)
